In order to expand and develop on the work completed in this thesis, one could do any of the following: 

1. Potentially look at building multiple hidden markov models for each commodity.
	1. There have been scenarios in the past and one can expect there to continue to be further scenarios where commodity prices do not all go up at once.  For example, in a previous long-term bull market, sugar reached its peak in 1974, but the commodity bull market continued for the rest of the decade \cite{DB}
