## Advantages of log returns
- Logarithm returns are symmetric which is easily seen by the fact that they are time-additive.  
- Logarithmic return is also called the continously compounded return, which means that the frequency of compounding does not matter. 

## Stationarity
- Although we have to check for stationarity in the time series, we can still apply our hidden markov model.
