In this thesis, a trading straegy using a Markov-switching model to identify regimes, and then building sets of principle components based off these regimes to identify relative value opportunities is examined.  This is done for windows of fixed and expanding length over different holding periods. The strategy is tested on rolling CBOT Corn futures data from 2010 through to 2022 sourced from the CME via the Nasdaq API.  Results for the strategy are compared to a standard PCA relative value strategy.  

The original contribution of this project is the incorporation of a Markov-switching model in conducting PCA.  The strategy is shown to perform better than a PCA strategy without regimes when an expanding window is used.  In the fixed window case, there is a detioration in the final Sharpe ratios.
