# Abstract

- Present general class of nonlinear time series Markov switching models for seasonal data which may exhibit periodic features in the hidden Markov process as well as in the laws of motion in each of the regimes.  
- This class of models allows for nontrivial dependence between seasonal, cyclical and long-term patterns in the data. 
- To overcome the competional burden, we adopt a Baysian approach to estimation and inference.  
- This paper contains two empirical examples as illustraiton, one using housing starts data while the other covers US post WWII individual production.  
- A periodic Markov regime-switching structure is one where the Markov chain is nonhomogenous, with the time variation of the state transition probabilities being purely periodic, ie having the same transition scheme each year during a particular quarter or month.
