# Regime switches and commonalities of the cryptocurrencies asset-class

* Gaussian and Autoregressive models which are selected using AIC and BIC.
* Investigate whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies share common regimes within the same time-period.  
* **GARCIA et al (2014); Ardia et al (2019) Koutmos(2019)**
	* In all three of the above the existence of multiple regimes for Bitcoin in particular is proven.
* Two states of high and low volatility are identified.  
* Estimate Gaussian and AR Hidden Markov Models for price differences up to four states.  
* I guess they look at price differences because you want stationary data.
* The preliminary analysis of ADF and KPSS tests show that the price differences are stationary.

# Regime Switching

* Regime switching models are important class of models used in finance.  

Though regime changes have been previously proposed by **Quandt(**1958) and Goldfield and Quant (**1973**), it was James Hamilton who introduced the comprehensive theory of hidden Markov Models and also suggested an estimation procedure based on Bayesian Filter. 
* **AIC AND BIC**
