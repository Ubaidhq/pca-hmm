***This paper is key in the entire study of hidden markov models since this is where a lot of the initial work in developing the algorithms was done.***

- The idea of characterissing the theoretical aspects of hidden markov modelling in terms of solving three fundamental problems is due to Jack Ferguson of IDA who introduced it in lectures and writing.  
- Appparently this paper provides a single source for acquiring the background require dto pursure further in this fascinating area of research.
- The resulting model (HMM) is called a doubly embedded stochastic process with an underlying stochastic process that is not observable, but can only be observed thorugh another set of stochastic porcesses that produce the sequence of observations.
- An interesting point is made about the coin-flipping game played behind curtains.  The three models are proposed and although the more complicated 3 coin model is more encompassing, for practical considerations some strong restrictions are required? 
- Generally the states are interconnected in such a way that any state can be reached from any other state (an ergodic model.  )
