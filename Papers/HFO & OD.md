# Futures Markets

+ A forward contract is traded in the OTC market and can be customized if neccessary whereas a futures contract is traded on an exchange and is standardized.  
+ The vast majority of futures contracts do not lead to delivery. 
	+ The reason is that most traders choose to close out their positions prior to the delivery period specified in the contract. 
+ Closing out a position means entering into the opposiute trade to the original one.
+ Example: if a trader went long in a futures position by buying a September futures contract on June 5th, they can close out their position by selling (shorting) a Sept futures contract on say June 10th.  Their profit or loss is tehn determined by the difference in the futures prices between June 5th and June 10th.
+ Delivery is so unusual that (paper) traders sometimes forget how the delivery process works.
	+ Note that it is still worthwhile reviewing delivery procedures because it is the *possibility* of final delivery that ties the futures price to the spot price.
