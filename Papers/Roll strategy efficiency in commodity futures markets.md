# Abstract 

* A large number of investment strategies invovle the decision of when and how to roll 
* The author defins roll to be when you sell a security and buy another (of the same type and with the same terms) with a longer period until expiration date (the roll forward decision)
* The risk is that although you are less likely to have any exposure to a backwardated or contango market as you get closer to expiration, the liqudity in that contract will drop sharply. 
* The above risk is coined as trade execution quality.  
* There are a number of conventional approaches to the roll forward decision, all of which exploit the *periodic* nature of expected execution quality in the period leading up to contract maturity.  
	* These can be categorised as either single-day or multiple-day strategies.  
* Single day rolling strategies usually just happen a fixed number of days before the contract goes to maturity.
