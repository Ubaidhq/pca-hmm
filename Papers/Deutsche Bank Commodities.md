Commodities are fundamentally different from stocks or bonds.  They do not generate dividends or coupon payments.  Their price within the market can generally be determined by basic laws of supply and demand. As such, their value comes from their inherent demand and *usefullness* in being consumed or transformed into something else that is consumed. 

In \cite{Gary Gorton}, it is confirmed that since 1959, commodity futures have produced better annual returns than both stocks and bonds, whilst having less risk.  Returns on commodity futures have also shown to be positively correlated with *inflation*.  Higher commodity prices were the leading wave of high prices in general, and why commodity returns do better in inflationary times, while stocks and bonds perform poorly \cite{DB}.  

Commodity markets in general can be broken down into four main classes: agriculture, energy, industrial and precious metals \cite{DB}.
