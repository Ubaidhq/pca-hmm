- A bank typicallly keeps track of between 30 and 40 different factors.  These include observables such as interest rates, inflation and industrial indices.  
- There are unobserved factors whill be represented by the finite state Markov Chain.  
- **We suppoed $X_k$ is not observed directly and the states might represent in some approximate way the psychology of the market, or the actions of competitors.**  
- # Abstract
Filtering and parameter estimation techniques from hidden Markov Models are applied to a discrete time asset allocation problem.  For the commonly used mean-variance utility explicit optimal strategies are obtained.
